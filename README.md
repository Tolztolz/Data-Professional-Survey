Data Professional Survey Analysis

The Data Professional Survey datasets was gotten from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx.  The dataset contains data from a survey of Data Professionals conducted by Alex Freberg.
Power Query was used in cleaning, query and exploration of the data and Power BI was used for visualization

This project presents an in-depth analysis of a survey aimed at data professionals, exploring their job roles, skills, tools, and trends in the industry. To collect and clean the data, Power Query was used to connect to the data source, transform and combine the data, and load it into Power BI. The analysis was then carried out in Power BI, leveraging its rich visualization, analytics, and sharing capabilities. The insights gained from this analysis shed light on the current state and future prospects of the data profession, and can be useful for job seekers, recruiters, educators, and researchers. The project code and report are available on GitHub, showcasing the use of Power Query and Power BI in a real-world scenario."
